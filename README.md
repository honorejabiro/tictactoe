# Tic Tac Toe AI

This project implements an AI agent that plays an optimal game of Tic Tac Toe using the **Minimax algorithm**. The AI evaluates all possible future game states and always chooses the move that maximizes its chances of winning (or minimizes loss), making it **unbeatable**.


---

## Features

- Turn-based game between a human and AI, or AI vs AI.
- Implements the Minimax algorithm with recursion and game tree exploration.
- AI never loses â€” it will win or force a draw.
- Clean Python implementation focused on clarity and correctness.

## Concepts Used

- Adversarial Search
- Game Theory
- Minimax Algorithm
- Recursion
- Optimal Decision-Making
